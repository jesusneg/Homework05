    "I think the double pendulum trajectories are really neat. They're a very simple system with surprisingly complex behavior. (Maybe it's just surprising to me?) For extra credit (or for inspiration for Physics Hack Day), consider some of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make an animation of the double pendulum trajectory. You can simultaneously animate the trajectories of both weights, see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum#/media/File:Trajektorie_eines_Doppelpendels.gif\">this  example</a>. \n",
    "* In your animation above, can you also do the \"gradual fading\" of the older trajectory points that is demonstrated in the example?\n",
    "* Here's something really cool: can you **sonify** the trajectory? Map the *velocity* of the mass to a pitch and then play the pitch as the pendulum moves. In this way, you model the *Doppler shift* of a buzzer attached to the double pendulum. You can find an example of the implementation of the `scipy` sound library <a href=\"https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.html\">here</a>... which is itself a fantastic example of a Jupyter notebook in Nobel-prize-worthy research.\n",
